Proposal

Summary
-------

Over the past ten years, the OSU Open Source Lab (OSUOSL) has provided an
amazing program for undergraduate students. Many of our students have gone on to
create their own successful startups and have changed the landscape of open
source themselves. However, our program at the lab does not meet the increasing
needs of industry and of Oregon State students. These students require a program
that teaches the basics of Devops, without hiring them at the OSUOSL.

This session introduces a new approach we’re taking at Oregon State to teaching
devops and FOSS development. Many universities focus solely on the theory of
computer science. As many know, this approach doesn't teach students the
necessary skills they need to work in industry. This year, we’ve started a
program called Devops Bootcamp which is a hands-on, informal workshop open to
any student at Oregon State. It was modeled after the Portland State University
Braindump program and modified to fit our needs.

Devops Bootcamp immerses college students in the basics of Linux, Linux system
administration and FOSS development practices. For the final project, students
build an entire infrastructure for a mock organization.
