So what is Packer?
==================

* Machine image building tool created by Mitchell Hashimoto (of Vagrant fame)
* Written in Go
* Makes your life easier

Supported Platforms
===================

.. csv-table::

  Amazon EC2, Digital Ocean
  Docker, GCE
  Openstack, Parallels
  QEMU (kvm), Virtual Box
  VMWare

What problem does Packer solve?
===============================

* One image building tool to rule them all
* Single configuration to create images across multiple platforms

  * Cloud? Vagrant? Docker? -- YES!

* Integrates into the cloud/devops model well

Terminology
===========

:Templates: JSON files containing the build information
:Builders: Platform specific building configuration
:Provisioners: Tools that install software after the initial OS install
:Post-processors: Actions to happen after the image has been built

Packer Build Steps
------------------

*This varies depending on which builder you use. The following is an example for
the QEMU builder*

#. Download ISO image
#. Create virtual machine
#. Boot virtual machine from the CD
#. Using VNC, type in commands in the installer to start an automated install
   via kickstart/preseed/etc
#. Packer automatically serves kickstart/preseed file with a built-in http
   server

Packer Build Steps
------------------

6. Packer waits for ssh to become available
#. OS installer runs and then reboots
#. Packer connects via ssh to VM and runs provisioner (if set)
#. Packer Shuts down VM and then runs the post processor (if set)
#. PROFIT!

Variables in Packer
-------------------

Variables allow you to set API keys and other variable settings without changing
the configuration file:

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "variables": {
      "aws_access_key": "",
      "aws_secret_key": ""
    },

    "builders": [{
      "type": "amazon-ebs",
      "access_key": "{{user `aws_access_key`}}",
      "secret_key": "{{user `aws_secret_key`}}",
    }]
  }

Environment Variables
=====================

You can also use variables to set environment variables within the packer
environment that can be used by provisioners.

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "variables": {
      "my_secret": "{{env `MY_SECRET`}}",
    },
  }

Setting variables
-----------------

You can set variables either via the CLI or importing them from a json file:

.. code-block:: bash

  # Via CLI
  $ packer build \
    -var 'aws_access_key=foo' \
    -var 'aws_secret_key=bar' \
    template.json

  # Via json file
  $ packer build -var-file=variables.json template.json

This makes it easy for you to adapt your automated builds as you need fit.

Building the Image

  $ packer build centos-7.0-x86_64-openstack.json
  qemu output will be in this color.

Using the command line
----------------------

.. code-block:: bash

  # Build an image from a template
  $ packer build template.json

  # Inspect at template to see its configuration
  $ packer inspect template.json
  Optional variables and their defaults:

    chef_version = provisionerless
    mirror       = http://centos.osuosl.org

  Builders:

    qemu

  Provisioners:

    shell

  # Validate proper json and packer configuration
  $ packer validate template.json
  Template validated successfully.

Machine readable output
-----------------------

Most commands allow readable output for scripts:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ packer inspect -machine-readable template.json
  1424621191,,ui,say,Optional variables and their defaults:\n
  1424621191,,template-variable,chef_version,provisionerless,0

Builders
--------

* Responsible for creating and build the machines.

  * QEMU, Virtual Box, EC2, etc

* Builder definition maps to exactly one build
* You can have multiple builder definitions using the same builder

  * You must have a unique ``name`` for each build definition

.. csv-table::

  Amazon EC2, Digital Ocean
  Docker, GCE
  Openstack, Parallels
  QEMU (kvm), Virtual Box
  VMWare

Amazon AMI Builder
------------------

amazon-ebs
  Create EBS-backed AMIs by launching a source AMI and re-packaging it into a
  new AMI after provisioning.

amazon-instance
  Create instance-store AMIs by launching and provisioning a source instance,
  then rebundling it and uploading it to S3

amazon-chroot
  Create EBS-backed AMIs from an existing EC2 instance by mounting the root
  device and using a Chroot environment to provision that device.

Docker Builder
--------------

* Builds docker images without the use of a ``Dockerfile``
* Able to provision containers with portable scripts that aren't tied to Docker
  itself
* Allows you to use tools such as Chef, Ansible, etc to build the container
* Must be run on a machine that already has docker installed

Provisioners
------------

.. csv-table::
  :widths: 30, 50

  Shell, Run either inline or shell scripts
  File Uploads, Upload files and use shell scripts to move files around as needed
  Ansible, Provision using playbook and role files
  Chef Client, Connect to a chef server and run chef
  Chef Solo, Run a Chef solo run by pointing to local cookbooks or uploading them
  Puppet Masterless, Run local manifests and modules
  Puppet Server, Connect to a puppet server and run puppet

Provisioners
-------------

.. csv-table::
  :widths: 30,50

  Salt, "Using Salt states, deploy a vm using Salt"
  PowerShell, "runs PowerShell scripts on Windows machines"
  Windows Shell, "runs scripts using cmd on Windows Machines"

Post-processors
---------------

.. csv-table::
  :widths: 20, 50

  Artifice, Overrides the artifact list from an upstream builder or post-processor
  Atlas, Uploads artifacts from your packer builds to Atlas for hosting
  compress, Compress VMWare or Virtualbox image using gzip
  docker-import, Imports the docker image locally
  docker-push, Push image to the docker repository
  docker-save, Saves docker image directly to a file
  docker-tag, Tags a build in the docker repository
  Vagrant, Converts artifact into a valid Vagrant box file
  Vagrant Cloud, Pushes artifact to Vagrant Cloud
  vSphere, Uploads artifact to a vSphere endpoint

Extending Packer
----------------

* You can extend packer using its plugin system
* All builders, provisioners and post-processors are plugins themselves
* Check out their documentation:
