Theory vs. Applied
------------------

.. note:: Emily & discuss own experience with how OSU teaches CS

- More focus on theory than applied

  - Classwork rarely mimics real-world
  - Difficult to apply theory

Student Jobs
------------

|

.. note:: Emily
    If you're lucky enough to get a job that's at all related to CS
    it's probably HELPDESK or TEACHING ASSISTANT. 

    Good for "plays well with others", "works hard", etc.

    Not good for learning real sysadminning / development, or MENTORSHIP

*Finding experience on campus*

- Limited roles and access
- Limited availability
- No structure

Insufficient Mentoring
----------------------

.. note:: Lance

|

.. figure:: _static/osl-noc2.jpg
  :align: right
  :scale: 45%

- No dedicated staff/faculty
- LUG's help, but not the solution 
- No centralized program

  - Need a place for advanced students to excel more
  - Also need an environment for *"newbies"*
- Limited qualified staff with time to mentor


OSL Student Involvement
=======================

Giving students real-world experience and mentorship

OSL Student Experience
----------------------

.. note:: Emily on own experience with how it's awesome
    
    *The good:* work w/ best, most experienced peers as well as a few full
    timers

    Learn how to deal with customers of ALL levels of technical skill -- some
    will walk you through patching a kernel, others will need to be walked
    through using SSH

    Deal with real-world scaling problems -- language barriers, time zones

    Ops start on ticket queue then move onto special projects; devs work on
    one of 3-4 dev team projects & are often project lead

    *The... less good:* Extremely self-directed, extremely high level of
    responsibility, things break REALLY BADLY if you do it wrong (could take
    Apache Software Foundation down by incanting at the wrong PDU, for example)

    These are all what we'd call good things but if you aren't ready yet they
    can be overwhelming and stressful in a bad way. 

    Also being surrounded by the best and brightest of your peers leads -- and
    this is many people i've talked to, not just myself, to impostor syndrome
    problems. we support each other, but still.


- Given full *"root"*
- Spend six months mentoring

  - Mix of full-timer and senior student mentorships
- Work on support tickets and customers
- Interact with people internationally
- Ownership of a project
- Treated like a full-timer

Scaling problem
---------------

.. note:: Lance

.. rst-class:: build

- Balancing FTE to Student ratios
- A lot of time and resource is put in mentoring
- OSL Students represent less than 1% of OSU CS population
- Budget constraints on hiring more students
- Only so much work to be done

DevOps Bootcamp
===============

Expanding DevOps beyond the OSL...

http://devopsbootcamp.osuosl.org

Portland State *"Braindump"*
----------------------------

.. note:: Lance

- Weekly meet up to teach being sysadmin
- In-depth teaching on specific topics (DNS, Apache, etc)
- Graduated system

  - Start out with helpdesk support
  - Get "non-root" access to systems
  - "Rooter"
- Year long program

  - Starts out with 60+ end up with ~10 solid recruits

http://braindump.cat.pdx.edu

Free Online Classes
-------------------

.. note:: Emily

    When figuring out what to do for bootcamp we had to ask what needs we'd be
    fulfilling that weren't already met by some awesome projects out there.

    Evaluated the options -- lots for dev, only one outstanding one for ops

    our community has a tendency to say "just go read the book / website /
    manpage and you'll know the tool", which is a great way of bringing in the
    people whose learning styles work like that, but quietly excludes
    everybody else

    Also, motivation: If just having these resources floating around the ether
    was enough to bring all interested students into devops, we wouldn't be
    having pipeline problems. 
    
    For really shy people scared of failure, peer
    pressure and support might be needed to get them to step outside their
    comfort zones into tech. Outgoing people, a group might be what it takes 
    to keep it interesting...

- Designed to be completely self-directed
- Need lots of time and specific learning style

- OpsSchool

   - Tends to be sysadmin-focused
   - Very old-school
   - Ops equivalent of CS MOOCs
- MIT OpenCourseWare
- Coursera
- edx.org


Adapt PSU's Braindump
---------------------

.. note:: Lance

Making it work for the OSL and OSU .. and DevOps Bootcamp was born!

**Goals:**

.. rst-class:: build

- Teach basic system administration skills
- Introduce FOSS development
- Introduce Devops philosophy
- Publicize all the content (Creative Commons, yay!)
- Eventually integrate into OSU EECS program
- Make it easy for anyone to attend and contribute

Program Structure
-----------------

.. note:: Emily

    Balance school commitments, organizer bandwidth, and the need to teach a
    LOT of stuff

    started biweekly, went to weekly

    Writing curriculum takes a LOT of time

    Exercises open-ended, some students ran with them and others did bare
    minimum

    Typical lesson 2 related topics, one devvier and one opsier, ~4 x 20-min
    blocks of talking punctuated by hands-on

- Weekly meet ups about a specific topic
- Weekly content planning meetings
- Simple *exercises* each week
- Combined lecture and hands on
- Driven by both OSL Staff and students

.. figure:: _static/dobc.jpg
  :align: right
  :scale: 60%

- Communication

  - Mailing list
  - IRC
  - LUG

Tools
-----

.. note:: Lance, with why we chose each

.. rst-class:: build

- Vagrant

  - CentOS/Debian VMs
- Github

  - Exercises, example applications & scripts
  - https://github.com/devopsbootcamp
- Sphinx-doc and Read The Docs

  - Hieroglyph for slides
- Google Hangouts Live (screen shot recording)
- OpenStack

  - *Planned for next iteration of bootcamp*

Curriculum Topics
-----------------

.. note:: Lance

- Linux Basics
- Basic System Administration
- Basic FOSS Development Methodologies
- Base infrastructure services for any organization

  - DNS, Email, web server, database servers, etc
- Introduce configuration management
- Content based from `CS312 Sysadmin class`_

  - *Last taught in 2009, planned for Winter Term 2015*

.. _CS312 Sysadmin class: http://osuosl.org/students/cs312

Learning from breaking
----------------------

.. note:: Emily:

  Yes most of us are self-taught but I've noticed that things I've learned from
  others via mentorship are much easier to teach in person. 
  
  on the
  diversity note, having a *safe* place to play is extremely important because
  when someone's dealing with the issues that plague minorities in tech
  (tokenism, impostor syndrome, etc.) there are a lot more factors telling you
  "no don't risk breaking that, even if you might learn something" than there
  would be for a non-minority.

  Braindump takes this further, with dedicated hardware and the more advanced
  students walk through pulling wires sometimes

- How did we learn these skills ourselves?

  - Self learning!
  - Support community (LUG, friends, mentors, etc)
- Access to a production-like environments ``==`` safe place to *play*
- Preconfigured by us, but then modified by them
- Introduce troubleshooting via breakage

Feedback
--------

.. note:: Lance

- Attendance

  - First meeting: 34 | Other meetings: 10-20
- Format seems to work
- Vagrant and Virtualbox can be a PITA
- Recording using Google Hangouts is great *(but buggy)*
- Having everything in git is awesome
- It takes a long time to make content
- We didn't cover everything we wanted
- Learn to be flexible
- K.I.S.S. (Keep It Simple Stupid)

So, you want to start a bootcamp?
---------------------------------

.. note:: Emily

    be careful of your own time/resources and avoid burning out; remember that
    everyone else is busy too and dropping the ball once or twice isn't the
    end of the world if you pick it back up

    Skills can be taught; enthusiasm can't.

- Resources are everywhere
- Offer bite-sized ways to contribute

  - Speak for 15 minutes on your specialty, vs. serve on a curriculum committee forever

- Time management

    - Automate yourself out of a job

Next Steps
==========

.. note:: Lance. Add picture

Building a mock infrastructure
------------------------------

- Build a breakable infrastructure

  - Best to learn from real-world experience
  - But not production (yet)
- Basic services:

  - DNS, Email, web, database, etc
- Develop a basic webapp collaboratively
- Utilize configuration management (puppet / chef)
- Use the cloud (i.e. OpenStack, AWS, etc)
- *Planning to implement this next year*

Plans
-----

- Continue to build more content *(and tweak it)*
- Include outside speakers from the industry
- Include contributions from external sources

  - Because, FOSS!
- Develop new curriculum in EECS program

  - Create a side track focused on DevOps
- Expand beyond OSU to other Universities
