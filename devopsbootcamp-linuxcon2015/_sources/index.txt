Current Learning Environment
============================

There be dragons!

Theory vs. Applied
------------------

- More focus on theory than applied

  - Classwork rarely mimics real-world
  - Difficult to apply theory

Student Jobs
------------

*Finding experience on campus*

- Limited roles and access
- Limited availability
- No structure

Insufficient Mentoring
----------------------

- No dedicated staff/faculty
- LUG's help, but not the solution
- No centralized program

  - Need a place for advanced students to excel more
  - Also need an environment for *"newbies"*

OSL Student Experience
======================

Giving students real-world experience and mentorship

OSL Overview
------------

- Services we provide

  - Co/Location
  - Virtualization (Cloud)

OSL Student Experience
----------------------

- Given full *"root"*
- Spend six months mentoring

  - Mix of full-timer and senior student mentorships
- Work on support tickets and customers
- Interact with people internationally
- Ownership of a project
- Treated like a full-timer

Scaling problem
---------------

.. rst-class:: build

- Balancing FTE to Student ratios
- A lot of time and resource is put in mentoring
- Represent less than 1% of total OSU CS population
- Budget and staff constraints on hiring more students

DevOps DayCamp
--------------
- Dual-tracked day-long conference: October 3, 2015
- Second year running
- Beginners track

  - Hands-on Linux Basics training

- Advanced track

  - Similar to DevOps Days content

- Roughly 100 in attendence
- Submit your CFP for the advanced track at DayCamp!
- http://devopsbootcamp.osuosl.org/daycamp/

What we've learned two years in
-------------------------------
- Attendance ranges from 30 at the start and dwindles towards 15 near the year
  end
- Weekly meetings are a bit too much for many students
- Creating quality content takes time and practice
- Learn to be flexible with the schedule and topics
- SSH Keys, Vagrant and VirtualBox are a PITA for beginners
- OpenStack is a great tool, but Horizon isn't the right frontend for beginners

Next Steps
==========

Plans
-----
- Continue to build more content *(and tweak it)*
- Develop new curriculum in EECS program

  - Create a side track focused on DevOps and open source
  - Integrate into eCampus EECS post-bac program
- Invite more outside speakers from the industry
- Invite more contributions from external sources

  - Because, FOSS!
